A simple software (or hardware!) defect record keeping system. Similar to that of JIRA by Atlassian.

## Core Web Vitals

The Core Web Vitals are the subset of Web Vitals that apply to all web pages, should be measured by all site owners, and will be surfaced across all Google tools. Each of the Core Web Vitals represents a distinct facet of the user experience, is measurable in the field, and reflects the real-world experience of a critical user-centric outcome.

The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds):

**Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading.

**First Input Delay (FID):** measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of 100 milliseconds or less.

**Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of 0.1. or less.
